                1) Currently, I am working on a project wherein I’m curating best practices on writing high-quality documentation that people want to read. I’ve also added extra resources and a bunch of useful starter templates. It has received over 2,500 stars, it featured as the #2 product of the day on Product Hunt, and was the #12 repo of the week on GitHub. Most importantly, it has helped a lot of folks in documenting their project and I’m proud of that.

                2) On some weekend around November 2018, <in hopes of killing boredom> I thought of making a Reddit bot. While I found myself myriad of guides on how to create a Reddit bot, there were very few, and very messy guides on how to deploy a bot on any cloud platform.
                <br><br>
                Due to this, I had to dig out information from multiple blogs, websites, videos, etc. While doing this, I tried to document as much as I could and as a result, I ended up having a short and to-the-point guide on how to deploy a Reddit bot on Heroku (a software as a service). I’ve open-sourced this guide to help out all the folks who are struggling with hosting their bot.

                3) During my 6th semester, I’ve worked on a project called <i>Single Image Super Resolution</i> which is a problem in which the proposed algorithm/model aims to obtain a high-resolution output from one of its low-resolution versions. While working on this project, I’ve read a lot of technical papers in a way such that I understand the material and <then am able> to succinctly write down key points to make the project report an interesting read.

                4) <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tata_Consultancy_Services" style="color: #FFF">TCS</a></b>, a multinational company annually organizes a national-level engineering innovation contest in which my team and I participated for the first time. During one of the rounds, we were asked to create a use case proposal for our idea. While creating our use case proposal, we read a lot of technical papers and consulted various professors. The judges liked our proposal and this helped us qualify for the next round in the ongoing competition.

                5) One of the first projects I’ve ever worked on was an intradepartmental chat application that was to be created for the employees for the Government of Sikkim. It was a team project and our team consisted of 6 members and 2 mentors, and I was given the role of maintaining the documentation and developing the UI/UX for the application.
                <br><br>
                This project taught me a lot about documentation, designing and the importance of the two. It was also the crux of my technical writing journey.
                <br><br>
                During the initial stages of the project, I wrote documents such as the PRD (Product Requirements Document) and the user stories which helped our team whenever we hit a blind spot in terms of our project vision.

                6) During my 5th semester, I worked on a project called <i>Automated Hydroponics</i> which involved automating the process of Hydroponics, a subset of hydroculture, a method of growing plants without using soil. It has a lot of benefits over traditional agriculture. While developing this project, I was responsible for documentation, writing the report as well as for creating the UI/UX.

                7) Over the past few months, I have been contributing to open-source documentation.
                <br><br>
                Here is a link to all the significant documentation-related contributions I’ve made:

                <br><br><br>
                Apart from this, I am well versed with tools like AsciiDoc, Doxygen, Sphinx, reStructuredText, and LaTeX.
